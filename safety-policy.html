            <h2>Food Safety Policy</h2>
            <p>Our food safety policy is designed to ensure that all products meet the highest standards of safety and
                quality. We adhere to strict guidelines and regulations to protect our consumers.</p>
            <p>Tannourine Mineral Water Company is committed to the implementation of the food safety management system.
                In order to produce and provide safe and healthy products, enhance customer’s satisfaction, and to meet
                and exceed expectations.</p>
            <p>The Company is committed to providing safe products that meet the Lebanese as well as the international
                natural mineral water standards.</p>
            <p>It develops, implements, and updates training programs for each employee to maintain food safety
                throughout all processes.</p>
            <p>Raw materials are purchased from approved suppliers that also meet the quality standards.</p>
            <p>The Company follows rigorous procedures and methods that prevent food contamination such as cleaning
                programs (during the production process, in storage areas…) and pest control.</p>

            <p>It ensures that the critical points are controlled through the implementation of food safety management
                system ISO 22000:2005.</p>

            <p>It provides a way to communicate with customers.</p>

            <p>This policy is performed by all employees in Tannourine Mineral Water in order to ensure our products’
                high quality.</p>
            <h4 class="A-H4">Quality Assurance</h4>

            <p>We, the Tannourine Group, have a state-of-the-art plant with experienced people in our Quality Assurance
                department and laboratories. They have expertise in monitoring and maintaining the plant quality control
                process. They carry out chemical, microbiological, and physical water tests hourly, daily, weekly, and
                even monthly through both the internal and external laboratory. Tests are applied on the spring (before
                bottling), during the bottling process, and on the final product (bottled and packaged water).</p>

            <p>All these steps, from procurement to production and delivery, include procedures that are fully
                controlled by a food safety team, are well defined, and highly efficient.</p>

            <p>Tannourine water is tested and analyzed in accordance with LIBNOR (Lebanese Standards Institution) in
                addition to international standards.</p>

            <h4 class="A-H4">Our quality certifications include:</h4>

            <p>ISO 22000 is the standard certification which was developed on the international level to demonstrate the
                organization's compliance with all relevant regulatory food safety requirements.</p>

            <p>The Emirates Quality Mark is a mark of uniformity granted to the products that can demonstrate compliance
                with the relevant UAE national standards.</p>
