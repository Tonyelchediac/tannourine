    <h2>Food Safety Policy</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>The Company is committed to providing safe products that meet the Lebanese as well as the international
            natural mineral water standards.</li>
        <li>It develops, implements, and updates training programs for each employee to maintain food safety

        <li>The Company follows rigorous procedures and methods that prevent food contamination such as cleaning
            programs (during the production process, in storage areas…) and pest control.</li>
        <li>It ensures that the critical points are controlled through the implementation of food safety management

    <h4 class="A-H4">Quality Assurance</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We, the Tannourine Group, have a state-of-the-art plant with experienced people in our Quality Assurance
            department and laboratories. They have expertise in monitoring and maintaining the plant quality control
            process. They carry out chemical, microbiological, and physical water tests hourly, daily, weekly, and
            even monthly through both the internal and external laboratory. Tests are applied on the spring (before
            bottling), during the bottling process, and on the final product (bottled and packaged water).</li>
        <li>All these steps, from procurement to production and delivery, include procedures that are fully
            controlled by a food safety team, are well defined, and highly efficient.</li>

            addition to international standards.</li>
    </ul>

        <li style="font-weight: bold;">ISO 22000 is the standard certification which was developed on the international level to demonstrate the
            organization's compliance with all relevant regulatory food safety requirements.</li>
        <li>The Emirates Quality Mark is a mark of uniformity granted to the products that can demonstrate compliance
            with the relevant UAE national standards.</li>
